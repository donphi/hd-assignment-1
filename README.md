## 🚀 Usage

To run the R code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:

   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   ```

3. Open **Assignment1.R** in RStudio or any R-compatible IDE. Make sure the working directory is set correctly:

   ```r
   setwd("path/to/repository")
   ```

4. Install the required packages as specified at the top of the `Assignment1.R` script.

5. Run the script to reproduce the analyses and results! 🎉

## 📋 Assignment Overview

The assignment required us to:

- Investigate healthcare challenges using R programming. 💉
